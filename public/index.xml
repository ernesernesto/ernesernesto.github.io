At that time around 3-years ago, we don&amp;rsquo;t have a dedicated mac mini that is used for building ios / android game and pandemic has just started, so we figured out we need to have a dedicated machine in order to unblock our programmers that need to have a working build on a device.</description></item><item><title>Building Simple Audio Visualization with Unity ECS Part III — ECS</title><link>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/buildingsimpleaudiovisualizationunitypartiii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2018 12:40:06 +0700</pubDate><guid>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/buildingsimpleaudiovisualizationunitypartiii/</guid><description>This is the last part from the three part series of creating a simple audio visualizer to learn ECS. The first part we talked about how to make things work with MonoBehavior way. The second part we change the MonoBehavior into a Jobified Unity Job System. Today we’re going to walk to our end goal, transforming our Audio Visualization into ECS form.
The promise of the new ECS system is the performance gain.</description></item><item><title>Building Simple Audio Visualization with Unity ECS Part II — Job System</title><link>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/buildingsimpleaudiovisualizationunityecspartii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 12:39:57 +0700</pubDate><guid>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/buildingsimpleaudiovisualizationunityecspartii/</guid><description>This is the second part of our journey to learn ECS on unity. If you haven’t read the previous post I recommend you to take a while to read that in order to know how the audio visualizer work with the old MonoBehavior way.
Today we’re going to take what’s written on the first part and change it into a Jobified Unity Job System.
The Job System, as explained on the Unity pages, take advantages of multiple cores that our machine have.</description></item><item><title>Building Simple Audio Visualization with Unity ECS Part I — MonoBehavior</title><link>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/buildingsimpleaudiovisualizationunityecsparti/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2018 12:25:50 +0700</pubDate><guid>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/buildingsimpleaudiovisualizationunityecsparti/</guid><description>Currently, I’m learning to learn the new ECS and Job system introduced in Unity 2018. Usually the quickest way to learn a new concept quickly is by creating something that could give you an instant gratification, in this case we’re going to build a simple audio visualization.
The new ECS and Job system now promise to give performance boost and a new way to approach problem, letting you focus on the actual problems you are solving which is the data and behavior of your game.</description></item><item><title>Debugging Memory Allocation</title><link>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/debuggingmemoryallocations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 12:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/debuggingmemoryallocations/</guid><description>Recently I was debugging some particular nasty bugs that happens on memory allocations, the intricate part is, it happens infrequently My app was crashing on a release build more frequently than in debug builds.
I was doing some manual memory allocations, at the start of the app it will load a saved data from a file into that memory. The app was doing fine until I started to write something to the saved data, then on the next launch it will start to crash intermittently on release build.</description></item><item><title>Symbolicate ios Submission Crash Report</title><link>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/symbolicateiossubmissioncrash-report/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 10:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>http://ernesernesto.github.io/writes/symbolicateiossubmissioncrash-report/</guid><description>Often times we get crash from ios submission report that goes like this
